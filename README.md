## My Coding Journey So Far:

As a recent graduate of [Devmountain's](https://devmountain.com) Python developer program, I'm committed to expanding and strengthening my technical skills. My coding journey started with a deep curiosity for the endless possibilities of technology. This passion led me to enroll in Devmountain's program, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and gained hands-on experience building a variety of [web-applications](https://youtu.be/PdNTFznkjA0). Since then, I've continued to hone my skills and explore new technologies through personal projects and online courses. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and I can't wait to see where this journey will take me next!
