There are many immensely talented individuals in the world capable of doing incredible things, but I believe the most inspiring work is accomplished when a collective is brought together by a shared idea.

That's why I love being part of a team with a strong mission and clear purpose. I aim to utilize my skills to contribute to the bigger picture. This desire has manifested in my role as a support specialist, bridging the gap between application and user by solving complex issues and enhancing user experience.

As a Technical Support Engineer at MagView, I support mammography clinics across the country, working alongside wonderfully talented individuals to address our customers' unique needs and concerns. Every day, I face a diverse range of technical issues, which I work with my team to troubleshoot and resolve.

Whether I'm coding, troubleshooting issues, or collaborating with other tech professionals, I’m dedicated to maintaining a positive outlook while seeking continuous self-improvement.
