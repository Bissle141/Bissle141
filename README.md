## My Coding Journey So Far:

With parents in the tech industry and later siblings as well, I have been surrounded by tech since I was young and have flirted with diving in myself many times. In highschool I joined the robotics team and a game design class. In both I was taught and exposed to a lot, mostly C++ and C#. <br></br>
When I went to college, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science, but after only a year the pandemic started in full swing and college became infeasible. However, after a bit of rerouting and waiting, I am back on track and am now attending Devmountain, a coding bootcamp where I will be focusing on developing my skills as a python focused developer.
